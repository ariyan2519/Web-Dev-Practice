    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <p>Stane's scientists are unable to duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane enters Stark/'s home and steals the one from his chest. Stark manages to replace it with his original reactor. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. 
        agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and overpowers them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. 
        The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, where Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. 
        This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane to fall into the reactor and he is killed in the explosion. 
        The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed "Iron Man". </p>
